<h1>FlappyBird</h1>
<h3>Just a simple game I made in Java.</h3>
<p>I randomly found a youtube video on how to code FlappyBird and decided to make my own FlappyBird while watching the video, the game is pretty identical from the one on the video, so if you want to take a look on it,
  here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw2MEG-FBsE&t=11s</p>
<p>To run this game you will need to have a Java compiler. If you already have one then:</p>
<ol>Follow the steps:
  <li>
    First, you will need to run this code on cmd, while on the repository folder:
    <code>javac App.java</code>
  </li>

    Then, you just need to run this code on cmd, while on the repository folder:
    <code>java App</code>
  </li>
</ol>
